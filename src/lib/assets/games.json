			"description": "Granite Noir: The Social Experiment is a first-person experimental game where YOU literally create the game for others.\n\nEnter a dark room. Wait 2 hours as a timer counts down to 00:00:00. Before you stands a black granite monolith inscribed with the wishes of previous players.\n\nWhen the timer reaches zero, make ONE wish. ONE permanent addition to the game. Your wish will be implemented by the developers and engraved on the monolith forever.\n\nTHE RULES:\n- One wish per player, for life\n- Every wish is implemented - no refusals, no exceptions\n- Implementation time: hours to months depending on complexity\n- Your wish shapes the experience for thousands who follow\n\nAt launch, the game is nearly empty: a dark room, a monolith, a timer, echoing footsteps. The game builds itself through players' cumulative wishes.\n\nThis isn't Early Access. This is a finished social experiment that evolves indefinitely.\n\nWill you collaborate with the community? Subvert expectations? Create chaos? The choice (and its permanent consequences) are yours.\n\n\"You're not buying a complete game. You're buying the power to CREATE the game for others.\"",

To succeed, you’ll need skill behind the wheel, dodging obstacles or running enemies over. All while building towers with strategic synergies capable of turning the tide of battle.\n\nSpeed, strategy and survival collide in this game where every turn can mean the difference between extinction and the salvation of humanity.\n\nThe game’s inspiration comes from the desire to complement the Tower Defense genre and eliminate those idle moments where players would simply speed up the game after placing towers and wait. In Gears of Glory you are in constant motion driving the van to upgrade towers, collect Gears, and run enemies over.\n\nThe gameplay and art are influenced by titles such as Gemcraft, Kingdom Rush, Thronefall, Rock and Roll Racing, Biker Mice from Mars, GTA2.",
